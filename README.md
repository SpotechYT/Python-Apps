# Apps
# 1. Collatz Sequence

This app is to test the collatz sequence and create a text file with all the possible patters to get to 1 for every number
WARNING: running this software WILL FILL UP YOUR STORAGE verry qucikly with the text document

How to use:
  1. Run the bat or the .py file
  2. sit back and relax while you watch your pc make a massive text file for no reason

I would really like if someone were to do this on a massive server to test the limits of the collatz sequence and see if there is a solution
